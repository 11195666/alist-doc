Since each person's link may be different, the share url also needs to be filled in for cookie mounting, and any share link can be used.

### cookies
The folder in the account is obtained through the cookie. The validity period of the cookie is unknown, and the test has not expired.

Open the browser developer tools, go to the network tab, then log in to Bluezoo Cloud, open the folder to be shared, and find the latest `https://pc.woozooo.com/doupload.php` request:
![doupload.php](https://store.heytapimage.com/cdo-portal/feedback/202112/01/d46acbac6f61094529656359fd406161.png)
You can see the cookie and the folder id to be shared.
If you do not fill in the folder id, it will default to the root directory.
### share url
Just fill in the external link sharing address and sharing password.
Blueplay Cloud can only share files in one folder, so it is normal to not see the folder.
